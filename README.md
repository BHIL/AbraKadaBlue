# BlueHat IL 2021

Here in our small kingdom you will face many challenges: some simpler, some harder.

Rules:
* Each challenge comes with everything you need in order to solve it - sometimes source code, sometimes binaries, sometimes both.
In any case - we assure you they are all solvable, so don't give up!

* Focus on the challenges and the underlying game - things such as XSS and DB manipulation will not be counted towards your points :)

* Keep in mind that the goal is to gain the highest number of points.

* Sharing information between contestants is strictly prohibited and may lead to disqualification.

* Feel free to join our friendly chat over at [discord](https://discord.gg/5dJ2wAtdnH) and watch out for the occasional hints we'll be dropping!

* Don't forget to check out the Menu -> Help.

* Note that all of the operations will be performed ssynchronously. We recommend you to try out everything before you act :)

Have fun and good luck!
